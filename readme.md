INSPIRATION - MY CHOICE
Last time I think about making a clickable mp3 player based on vintage skin. 
My very last choice turns on WALKMAN by SONY. This is my final project.

FEATURES
My aplication includes clickable elements - buttons: play, rewind, forward, stop, and radio.
Everything is based on:
- css
-java script (jquery)
... also i make a few animation. For example- wheels of cassete tape located inside of my walkman.
Antenna make move too (when radio starts play).

INSTALL
Except files .css and .js you should turn attention on images .jpeg and music files located in "/music"
# WALKMAN
